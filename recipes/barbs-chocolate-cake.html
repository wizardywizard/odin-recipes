    <li>In a large mixing bowl, add the following ingredients one at a time, beating well after each addition:
        eggs, white sugar, 2 tablespoons butter or margarine, oil, 1/2 cup cocoa, buttermilk and vanilla.

    <li>To Make the Icing: Begin by beating together 1/2 cup butter or margarine, confectioners' sugar and 2/3 cup cocoa; add 1 teaspoon vanilla, milk and coffee. Beat until very smooth.
        Add more confectioners' sugar until you obtain the consistency you want. Spread on cake.</li>
